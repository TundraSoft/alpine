## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 🐳 **Docker** (latest stable version)
- 🐙 **Git** for version control
- 📝 **Basic knowledge** of Dockerfiles and containerization
- 🧠 **Understanding** of the base technology (Alpine, Ubuntu, etc.)

### Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** thoroughly
6. **Submit** a pull request

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TundraSoft/REPO_NAME.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Build the image locally
docker build -t local-test .

# Test the image
docker run --rm -it local-test
```

### Environment Setup

- Use latest stable Docker version
- Ensure sufficient disk space for image builds

## 🔒 Security Issues

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

🚨 **Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities!**

Instead:
- Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new)
- Email security-related issues to maintainers
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow time for assessment and fix before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

- Always scan images for vulnerabilities
- Keep base images updated
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Avoid including sensitive information in images
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface

---

## 📏 Code Standards

### Dockerfile Guidelines

```dockerfile
# Use specific base image versions
FROM alpine:3.22.0

# Group related RUN commands to minimize layers
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache \
        package1 \
        package2 && \
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Use meaningful labels
LABEL maintainer="TundraSoft" \
      version="1.0.0" \
      description="Brief description"

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1000 appgroup && \
    adduser -D -u 1000 -G appgroup appuser

# Set proper permissions
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup files/ /app/

# Use explicit COPY instead of ADD when possible
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Expose only necessary ports
EXPOSE 8080

# Use exec form for ENTRYPOINT and CMD
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["--default-option"]
```

### Shell Script Guidelines

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Use meaningful variable names
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly CONFIG_FILE="/etc/myapp/config.yml"

# Function documentation
# Description: Does something useful
# Arguments: $1 - input parameter
# Returns: 0 on success, 1 on failure
function do_something() {
    local input="$1"
    
    if [[ -z "$input" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Input parameter required" >&2
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "Processing: $input"
    return 0
}

# Error handling
if ! do_something "$1"; then
    echo "Error: Failed to process input" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```
